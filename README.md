# functional-art

Inspired by [RC's](https://recurse.com/about) #creative-coding stream and [this blog post](https://paytonturnage.com/writing/generating-art-with-haskell/)!

You can read the whole writeup on this in the [blog post](https://juicetin.bearblog.dev/generative-art-in-haskell) that I wrote for it, but tl;dr:

Some really cool things you can do with the tools built in this file! Will be actively tinkering here and there with this as I research new designs, but ultimately has been incredibly helpful way to do something ~ tangible ~ in Haskell and learn a lot of the language and concepts in the process.
